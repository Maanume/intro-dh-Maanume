The process of dereferencing and building my map was straight-forward. The map needed two different types of data. The first was the georeferenced red-lining map of Minneapolis, MN. With this map already georeferenced, I did not have to plot points on a base map to get the red-lining map geographically-oriented correctly. I then added data from the 2010 census to create another layer of my map. This data looked at the populations of specific blocks within counties of states, and separated the population in groups related to race. I think specified within this data that I wanted the group ‘white alone’ to be the defining category of my map. This created a map that is colored based on the size of the white population within a block group. 
	My map looks at a map created by the Home Owners Loan Corporation agency for the city of Minneapolis, MN during the era of the New Deal. This map sought to color-code “credit worthiness and risk on neighborhood and metropolitan levels” (Introduction, Mapping Inequality). These maps are inherently racist, and can give the viewer an inside look to the ideas of races and segregation during this period. Amy Hillier argues these maps led to disinvestment in the areas that were graded C or D, and ultimately shaped the investment and development in areas of the cities that were “racially and ethnically homogenous” (Hillier, Redlining in Philadelphia, 2002).   It can also provide a view of the relationship between wealth and poverty in the United States during the New Deal era. The other piece of my map is census data from 2010. This data separates the population of specific block groups into racial categories. This allows the viewer to see if red-lining during the 1930s and 40s led to segregation based on race that is present in the twenty-first century. Residential spaces are being represented through both sets of data and place is defined by the grade it was given during the 1930s and 40s, and if this grade has impacted how the area has developed since the era of the New Deal, and what type of population resides there now. 
	My map generates questions about how this color-coded map from the New Deal era affected development within certain areas of the city. Were certain groups of people excluded from specific areas of development because of race and economic-class? Did areas with a high number of non-white residents face disinvestment after the creation of these red-lining maps? Did the creation of graded areas force individuals in C and D grade areas to stay because the other areas become more segregated or too expensive? Are C and D graded areas still facing stigmas from the redlining of the 1930s and 40s? Did the classification of D-grade lead to the gentrification of these areas and the forceful push out of certain groups of people who have historically occupied an area? 
	In a specific area of Minneapolis, MN on the east side of the Mississippi River is a D-graded area labeled D12. The documents that accompany the redlining map state that this area was one of the older areas of the northeast section of the city, and was occupied by Syrians, Italians and Southern Europeans during this period, and the population was constantly changing. It was undesirable because it needs a lot of rehabilitation and there hasn’t been much new construction in recent years (Document for D12 Minneapolis, Mapping Inequality). Looking at census data from 2010, block groups within this area are now dominated by a white population. This finding begs the question how much racial identification has changed, are Italians and southern Europeans considered white in today’s understanding? Would this then imply that the population has only changed slightly the populations who were not considered white before are now put in that category. Or did the population actually shift and new groups identifiable as white moved into the area. In one particular block group that almost aligns perfectly with part of the D12 on the redlining map has a population of 1,930. Of that population, 1,575 are white, 190 are Black or African American, 32 American Indian, 73 Asian, and 74 other combined. We are unable to see if development took place within this area to alter the population within the data we have in the map. When looking at the county on Social Explorer, the population is still dominated by whites. It is however, difficult to see how other things like education, family structure, etc. impact the specific area of D12 and the block group because the county is rather large, and the data might not exactly match the data from the small block group. 
	The redlining map from the New Deal era only give one interpretation of place and space in the city of Minneapolis during the 1930 and 40s. Adding census data from this period could add another layer to understanding the city during this period. It could also challenge the redlining map to see if the creators of these maps were inherently racist and bias when grading certain areas of the city. This would bring a clearer picture of Minneapolis as a space in the 1930s and 1940s. It would also be hard to truly understand how Minneapolis from the New Deal era transformed into the city of today with the two sets of data we have within my map. It would be interesting if would possibly use the data from renewing inequality to see how city projects impacted areas, how this correlated to the redlining maps, and how it affects the definition of the city as a place today. It would possibly be beneficial to see the change of population over time and the city projects that took place to see if they somehow related back to the redlining map. It would also be beneficial to look at other categories like income and education to get a more comprehensive idea of how the city changed and how place and space changed in definition with the shift of people and the development of areas.
