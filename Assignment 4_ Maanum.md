The data I selected is from the Supreme Court database organized by Washington University in St. Louis, which assigned each Supreme Court case to a legal issue. This database contains the entire span of the Supreme Court from 1791 to present. The data I am using for this assignment consists of court cases assigned to the legal issues free exercise of religion and the establishment of religion. Free exercise of religion is protected by the First Amendment where it states that Congress shall not make a law prohibiting the free exercise of religion. The establishment of religion is also protected by the First Amendment and it means neither a state or the federal government can set up a church, nor can they pass laws to aid religion. There are 60 different cases involving the issues of free exercise of religion and the establishment of religion that have been heard by the Supreme Court. 
	The centrality plot of my network shows that the case School District of Abington Township, Pennsylvania, Et Al. V. Schempp Et Al. in 1962 is a critical case for all relating to free exercise of religion and the establishment of religion. This case ruled that Pennsylvania’s law that required students to read the Bible every morning, and the Abington Township rule that required students to recite the Lord’s Prayer were found to violate the religious freedom of students as protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The network indicates the decision of this case the most cited case among these two issues. It can then be inferred that this case is a landmark case in regards to establishment and freedom of religion, specifically in schools. It can be questioned whether this case led to the examination of how religion was being controlled in the workplace, and other areas of society.  
	Another interesting observation is the cluster plot of my network. Within my network there are 10 different communities. This indicates that there are smaller communities within the network citing each other. It would be interesting to see if these communities have distinctive characteristics, for example if a specific part of an issue is more important in one community than another. 
	When plotting my network by year, the data shows that many cases relating to free exercise of religion and the establishment of religion were brought to the Supreme Court in the 1980s. This leads to the question as to why the majority of these cases were discussed at this point in time. What was going on in the 1980s that led to these types of discussions? Were certain ideas of freedom of religion popular in society and culture at this time?
	I think a major critique with networks is the problem of centrality without full knowledge of the network, so sampling centrality can lead to distorted centrality scores (Weingart, Demystifying Networks, JDH). I also think networks tend to be overly used, and their importance outweighs other types of data analysis that may be better suited for different projects. I think it is definitely important for researchers to really consider what type of tool and analysis will be most productive. I think a great way of using networks is in relation to topic modeling. A level of analysis has already been done to create the topics and by using networks it can be seen how these topics relate to each other within a corpus. Scott Weingart explains, “Using networks, we can see how documents relate to one another, how they relate to topics, how topics are related to each other, and how all of those are related to words.” (Weingart, Topic Modeling and Network Analysis). Networks can be a great way to represent topic models. 
	Within my network, I wish there was a way to see when a case cites another case. We can only see they are connected but we cannot see why they are connected. I think that would be beneficial when looking at networks, to see the why. But I guess sometimes the whole point is seeing a connection and then questioning why such connections exist. This is the driving research question.
