   For my corpus I selected The English Historical Review, a historical journal that publishes articles related to British, European and world history from the classical era onwards. It is the oldest surviving English language academic journal in the field of history. It includes major articles and review articles as well as an extensive range of reviews of books. I chose this article because of the large amount of data, and I thought it would be interesting to see what topics would be produced.
   
   I chose to used 30 topics in my topic modeling visualization. I thought this would be a good number for the size of the data set, and to somewhat still keep the topics broad. The initial findings indicate that many topics focus on the english-speaking world specifically England, centering on internal changes and events and their relationships with other nations. The topics show a range of ideas and areas being discussed like foreign policy, politics and religion. It seems there is an emphasis on the theme of politics because various topics relate back to it, so it is possible to hypothesize that the theme of politics is an important within The English Historical Review. It is interesting because the topics illustrate that this journal focuses on England as a whole and not specifically on the people of the nation and how life was for them. Instead, it  looks at how England and its elite dealt with matter related to the nation and governance. The topics express a lack of focus on the arts and culture of the society, and more focus on how the society is run, by government and religion. 
   
      I think in the future it would be interesting to with a higher number of topics to see if they become more specific. It would also be beneficial to see if over the years certain topics and themes were more popular than others. It could be possible to see if current events of that period influenced the articles being produced. Looking at the topics over time, it could be possible to document where major shifts in academic thought take place, allowing for a creation of a timeline in the changes of thought within the journal.
      
      Topic modeling is a great tool for identifying patterns in a set of data. It is helpful for looking at a large corpus, and instead of looking at individual documents it looks at all of the data set as a whole to see trends and patterns throughout (Brett, Journal of Digital Humanities, 2012). Topic modeling also helps to compress raw data into structured data, allowing it to be easier to analyze (Weingart and Meeks, Journal of Digital Humanities, 2012). For example with the diary of Martha Ballard, Cameron Blevins was able to topic model 27 years daily diary entries, and the results were very similar to those of historian Laurel Thathcher Ulrich (Blevins, personal blog, 08-31-2009). There are limitations however with topic modeling. Topic modeling gives you groups of words but it is up to the researcher to assign a topic to these groups. This could be problematic because some individuals may interpret the groups of words in different ways. It can cause scholars to move away from not go into specifics like interpreting language (Weingart and Meeks, Journal of Humanities, 2012).
