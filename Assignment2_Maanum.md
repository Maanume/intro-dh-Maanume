   For my corpus I selected The English Historical Review, a historical journal that publishes articles related to British, European and world history from the classical era onwards. It is the oldest surviving English language academic journal in the field of history. It includes major articles and review articles as well as an extensive range of reviews of books. I chose this article because of the large amount of data, and I thought it would be interesting to see what topics would be produced.
   
   I chose to used 30 topics in my topic modeling visualization. I thought this would be a good number for the size of the data set, and to somewhat still keep the topics broad. The intial findings indicate that many topics focus on the english-speaking world specifically England, centering on internal changes and events and their relationships with other nations.
