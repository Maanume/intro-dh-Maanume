### 2017-09-18: Distant reading
"We need distant reading, Moretti argues, because its opposite, close reading, can’t uncover the true scope and nature of literature. Let’s say you pick up a copy of “Jude the Obscure,” become obsessed with Victorian fiction and somehow manage to make your way through all 200-odd books generally considered part of that canon. Moretti would say: So what? As many as 60,000 other novels were published in 19th-century England — to mention nothing of other times and places."
 
I understand this desire to understand all literature in a period; to see if plot structures are the same, if protagonists interact with other characters the same on average, etc. I think it interesting to think about if we, human beings, can define a literature age by quantitative data found within it.

"The trouble is that Moretti isn’t studying a science. Literature is an artificial universe, and the written word, unlike the natural world, can’t be counted on to obey a set of laws. Indeed, Moretti often mistakes metaphor for fact."

I think it is hard for me to comprenhend why it is so important for Moretti to create a set of laws for literature, when there is no way for it to be controlled and institutionalized in a sense. Yes, there were rules and stipulations whenn publishing but I don't think authors adhere to a certain way of writing all the time.

"Literature, he argues, is “a collective system that should be grasped as such.” But this, too, is a theology of sorts — if not the claim that literature is a system, at least the conviction that we can find meaning only in its totality."

I just thought this was a good quote, I have to disagree and say I don't think literature is a system. I don't think absolute truths can be found within it.

### 2017-09-25: Topic modeling I

Topic Modeling: Introduction

 "As you read through the article, you use a different color for the key words of themes within the paper as you come across them. When you were done, you could copy out the words as grouped by the color you assigned them."
 
 Coming from a historical background, this makes sense to me because I am always highlighting and look for important ideas through out a text. This simple explination helps me understand topic modeling.
 
 "Many humanists use MALLET and by extension LDA. MALLET is particularly useful for those who are comfortable working in the command line, and it takes care of tokenizing and stopwords for you.'
 
 I do not quite understand what MALLET or LDA are and how they are useful. I also am not quite sure what a command line is and how it applys to these program and topic modeling.
 
  WEINGART AND  MEEKS Reading
  
 "He explains the basic principles behind topic modeling, frames it in relation to probabilistic modeling as a field, and explores modeling as a tool for finding and expressing meaning."
 
 How does probablistic modeling differ from topic modeling? This passage is not confusing to me, I'm just curious how these programs differ from one another.
 
 "Rather the opposite is true: digital humanists offer the jaundiced realization that computational techniques like topic modeling — long held inaccessible and unapproachable and therefore unassailable — are not an upgrade from simplistic human-driven research, but merely more tools in the ever-growing shed."
 
 This passage makes sense that it acknowledges the benefits and innovations of computational techniques, but also the limitations and problems that go along with introducing these techniques into the humanities.
 
 MARTHA BALLARD’S DIARY
 
 "In order to address this issue, for any word I was examining I made sure to normalize its frequency – first by dividing it by the total word count for that year, then by dividing it by the average usage of the word over the entire diary. This allowed me to visualize how a word’s relative frequency changed from year to year."
 
 I never thought about the fact that variations within data, like from one year to the next, may need to be accounted for and calibrated so results are not skewed.
 
 "But MALLET is completely unconcerned with the meaning of a word (which is fortunate, given the difficulty of teaching a computer that, in this text, discoarst actually means discoursed). Instead, the program is only concerned with how the words are used in the text, and specifically what words tend to be used similarly."
 
 How does the program learn to associate certain words with otherss? Or does it just look for patterns between words to determine that they are similar and should be grouped together? I do not quite understand how the program may pick up on these topic words.
 
 BERRY Reading
 
 "Understanding digital humanities is in some sense then understanding code, and this can be a resourceful way of understanding cultural production more generally: for example, just as digital typesetting transformed the print newspaper industry, eBook and eInk technologies are likely to do so again. We thus need to take computation as the key issue that is underlying these changes across mediums, industries and economies."
 
 This is interesting because I also feel that i do not completely understand Digital Humanities because I have never learned or worked with different coding methods. Thus, I do not know their differences or how they are suited for certain types of computing.
 
 "If software and code become the condition of possibility for unifying the multiple knowledges now produced in the university, then the ability to think oneself, taught by rote learning of methods, calculation, equations, readings, canons, processes, etc., might become less important."
 
 This is interesting that individual learning may become less important if knowledge is gathered and analyzed with computational techniques. I do not think the ability to think for oneself with diminish because everyone 

### 2017-10-02: Topic Modeling II

Harper Lee Reading

"The researchers used a computer program to tally the frequency of common words 4 —“the,” “a,” “he,” “she”—and other “function” words that they said typically make up 50% of a novel. Both Ms. Lee and Mr. Capote sent out clear signals of authorship based on how often they used such words—a result that scholars in the growing field of digital
humanities have found with other writers, too."

What other tools are used to determine an author? If authors have very similar patterns, are there other patterns that are looked for? How distinctive are authors in their use of common words?

"Other parts of the text mining study strongly attest to Ms. Lee’s voice."

Is there anyway to be a hundred percent certain that an author wrote a work based on word patterns? I also wonder how often other authors influence one another and this can impact writing styles.

Trump Reading

"When Trump wishes the Olympic team good luck, he’s tweeting from his iPhone. When he’s insulting a rival, he’s usually tweeting from an Android."

This is probably a really dumb question, but how can you tell that a tweet was posted on an iphone vs an andriod? I have never noticed that on Twitter. Could you also do this same type of text analysis on other social media like Facebook using the same program?

"Trump on the Android does a lot more tweeting in the morning, while the campaign posts from the iPhone more in the afternoon and early evening."

Looking at the time people post things on social media would be an interesting study to see how the info posted differs at different periods. It would also be cool to use this to see if people in certain regions or countries have similar social media habits.

Mining the Dispatch

"This distribution has much to recommend it. About 14% of the piece comes from the topic I've labeled "entertainment and culture"—reasonable as this has something to do with fashion."

Did they get groups of words and create the topic names themselves, similar to what we did with MALLET?

"Could it be that enslaved African American men and women destabilized the slave hiring market by using the chaos of war mobilization in and around Richmond to run away in increasing numbers? This is a question that can be formulated from but not answered by these graphs alone, that will require using more traditional research methods to investigate."

It super cool that this type of program can generate topics and results that could then lead to new historical research or ask questions that haven't been discussed before.

Sing At 40

"The assumption operative in this type of graph is that scholarship can be viewed as conversations among various participants represented by particular sources; sources that tend to be cited together are being put into conversation with one another and are thus representative of a particular strain or school of thought within a field."

I think its interesting that a graph can show a specific strain of thought, something that may have not been connected before this specific program was done.

"The size of each circle is a function of the number of total citations it has accrued. The thickness of the links between nodes is a function of the number of times the sources have been cited together. The color of the nodes is determined by the Louvain community-detection algorithm."

How do you create a graph with this data and create this specified information in relation to color and thickness links?
