### 2017-09-18: Distant reading
"We need distant reading, Moretti argues, because its opposite, close reading, can’t uncover the true scope and nature of literature. Let’s say you pick up a copy of “Jude the Obscure,” become obsessed with Victorian fiction and somehow manage to make your way through all 200-odd books generally considered part of that canon. Moretti would say: So what? As many as 60,000 other novels were published in 19th-century England — to mention nothing of other times and places."
 
I understand this desire to understand all literature in a period; to see if plot structures are the same, if protagonists interact with other characters the same on average, etc. I think it interesting to think about if we, human beings, can define a literature age by qualitative data found within it.

"The trouble is that Moretti isn’t studying a science. Literature is an artificial universe, and the written word, unlike the natural world, can’t be counted on to obey a set of laws. Indeed, Moretti often mistakes metaphor for fact."

I think it is hard for me to comprenhend why it is so important for Moretti to create a set of laws for literature, when there is no way for it to be controlled and institutionalized in a sense. Yes, there were rules and stipulations whenn publishing but I don't think authors adhere to a certain way of writing all the time.

"Literature, he argues, is “a collective system that should be grasped as such.” But this, too, is a theology of sorts — if not the claim that literature is a system, at least the conviction that we can find meaning only in its totality."

I just thought this was a good quote, I have to disagree and say I don't think literature is a system. I don't think absolute truths can be found within it.
