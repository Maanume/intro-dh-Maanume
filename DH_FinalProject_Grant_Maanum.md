#### Abstract

This project combines historical maps and photographs of the London Blitz with a present-day map and current images to create a product that can be used to research the change in London, physically and socially, after WWII. This project hopes to answer questions surrounding the change in the definition of space and place in the city, as well as provide a comprehensive source for further research relating to London and the impact of WWII. This project will be beneficial to various fields within the humanities. The project will consist of georeferencing various maps and photographs together to create a dynamic and interactive map that is easy for everyone to use. The sources for this map will consist of a map detailing the location of bombs dropped during the Blitz, one illustrating the range of damage done by bombs dropped, as well as a present-day satellite map with the capability to view street images. This map will also feature historic photos of destruction created by the Blitz. The goal of the project is to allow users to have a better understanding of the impact of the Blitz on London, as well as providing the resources to demonstrate how the destruction created new notions of space and place for London residents. This project will hopefully spur further research in other cities in Britain and Europe using this type of research model. The finished map will be displayed on a website that is free to access and use by researchers and the public. 

#### Narrative
##### Enhancing the Humanities
I request an NEH Digital Humanities Level I grant to create a dynamic and interactive map of the London that shows how London changed after the Blitz. The Blitz was a German bombing offensive against Britain that took place between 1940-1941 during World War II. This map will examine how the destruction of the Blitz changed London physically and socially. Key questions to be answered by this map include: How did the Blitz change the definition of space and place in London? How did the destruction and reconstruction change the layout of the city? Did the meaning of place change? How did the Blitz change how residents interacted and understood the city? The project’s primary goal is to create a map that scholars and the public can use to investigate how the Blitz changed London in relation to space and place, along with any other research questions created that can be answered by this type of map. 

This project is important toward the study of history, geography, British studies, anthropology, and urban studies. This project intends to create a center of information in relation to the impact of the Blitz, seen visually through place and space. This map can further the understanding of the Blitz's impact in 1940-1941, but also how it impacted the future structure of the city of London. This map, combined with primary source literature, can show how cultural boundaries in the city changed, or how residents experienced the city in new ways because of the Blitz. This can shed light on the development of a sense of place after 1941. Understanding how the destruction caused reconstruction and urban renewal can contribute to urban studies. Overall, this project can expand the research questions surrounding the Blitz during WWII by combining information into one interactive map. 

The map with have four different elements. The first will be a satellite map, using the Google software that will allow users to use the browser Street View images feature. This satellite map will give users a current look at the city of London and its layout. The second map will be a map created by the project titled Bomb Sight. This map shows all the locations of the bombs dropped on London during the Blitz, and gives a range between dates to when the bomb was dropped. The third element would be the London County Council (LCC) Bomb Damage Maps 1939-1945. There is a total of nine maps covering the London area. The base map for these damage maps are from 1916, and the bomb damage is hand-colored on the map. The different colors indicate the scale of damage done to the area:  black indicating total destruction, purple is damaged beyond repair, red is seriously damaged- doubtful if repairable, pink is seriously damaged- repairable at cost, orange is general blast damage- not structural, yellow is blast damage- minor in nature, and green is clearance areas.  The final element of the project is georeferenced photos. These photos can be provided by the Imperial War Museum Archives, London Metropolitan Archives, BBC Archives, and the National Archives.  

The structure of the map will allow users to move between the past and the present. By using maps from the 1940s and maps of today, users will be able to see visually the spatial impact of the Blitz; seeing the location of every single bomb that fell on London. The map will also allow users to visually understand how notions of place changed after the Blitz. Using photos from the 1940s and images from the Street View on Google Maps gives users the opportunity to understand how areas changed, may it be from commercial to residence or vice versa which can impact how that specific area is understood and used. The map will provide users with a transparency range for each map layer, so the different maps can be compared to one another separately. This project provides a way for users to immerse themselves in the Blitz by seeing where the bombs dropped along with photos of the destruction created by these bombs, as well as allowing them to travel to the present to see how this destruction shaped present-day London and its urban layout. Below, I have provided a mock-up of the map and its features:

This project will utilize ArcGIS. This tool will help with layering the maps correctly, and will allow for the transparency of each map to shift. This tool will also allow for the georeferencing of the photos which would be attached to the LCC Bomb Damage Maps so users can immediately see the damage represented by the map. If the archives do not have the location of the photo, I think it would be helpful to invite the public to help identify locations of photos because there are many amateur historians and those interested in WWII that I think would be willing to help. I believe it would also be interesting to possibly initiate crowd-sourcing for receiving historic photos if the project exhausts the archives. This is an approach similar to that of historypin, which will be explained later. I think this may also be a great way to get the public interested in this project and its future.  It will also be beneficial for users to see the photos and then be able to browse the Street View images from Google Maps to see how the area has possibly changed because of the damage done by the Blitz.

The anticipated outcome for this project is the creation of a website with a free interactive map available for use by scholars and the public. The final product will hopefully provide evidence indicating a change in the definition of space and place in London during and after World War II. This project will expand the understanding of the Blitz through the use of many different sources combined, as well as add to the study of WWII and its impact of Britain. Hopefully this project will lead to similar projects on other British cities impacted by the Blitz, like Coventry and Liverpool, to understand how the meaning of space and place changed within their context. I think it would also be possible to expand the type of project to other cities in Europe that were bombed during WWII if the specific sources are available. This could lead to new research questions and a bigger investigation to how space and place changed in Europe overall, not just in particular areas. 

I am requesting $30,000 from the NEH to fund the organization and implementation of this project. This money will be used to pay the main contributors of the project, pay a hired web developer to create a dynamic website, gain access to certain archives, to attain the right to use Google’s software for their satellite map and browser for Street View images, as well as attain the rights to use the Bomb Sight map and LCC Bomb Damage Maps. Money will be put aside to create an emergency fund to cover any unknown obstacles that may appear along the way. Funds not used in the creation of the project can help in the maintenance and updating of the project after it is complete, as well as to keep the project available to the public. 

##### Environmental Scan
The proposed project expands, advances and somewhat combines the work of two different projects. The first is a project titled Bomb Sight, the project providing the map layer containing the locations of all the bombs dropped on London between 1940-1941. The Bomb Sight project maps the London WWII bomb census between July 10, 1940 and June 6, 1941. This project was created by a collaboration between Dr. Catherine Jones of the University of Portsmouth and The National Archives. The project scanned original 1940s bomb census maps, georeferenced the maps, and then digitally captured the geographical locations of all the falling bombs recorded on the original maps. The project allows users to click on the individual bombs and see contextual images of the neighboring area. This project makes this map available to citizen researchers, academics and students. Bomb Sight was funded by JISC- Joint Information Service Committee under Strand C: Clustering Digital Content of their Content Programme 2011-2013, and the funding ran from January 2012 to January 2013 (about the project, bombsight.org). 

My project differs considerably from the Bomb Sight project. While the Bomb Sight projects stays within the time of the Blitz, my project moves beyond the 1940s to consider the present and how it was shaped by the bombings. My project also has added map layers to create a more in-depth understanding of the impact of the Blitz by combining the Bomb Sight map with the LLC Bomb Damage maps. The Bomb Sight project provides historic photos but in a general sense. The photos are meant to supplement the map to contextualize it, but doesn’t provide specific locations for the photos. It just states the photos are from the general area, and we do not know how big to consider this area. My project would offer exact locations for historic photos so users can accurately see how an area was impacted by the Blitz. I think this creates a bigger impression on users because they can see where a bomb dropped, used the LCC maps to see the level of damage and then use the georeferenced photos to experience the actual damage. 

The second project is a called historypin, and it provides tools and methods for communities to tell their histories. Historypin develops and maintains storytelling methods for different cultural organizations like the BBC, Historic England and the National Archives. Essentially this projects helps in the creation of photo boards where photos can be pinned to locations. In turn, the photos found in a particular collection can tell the story of local community or specific event in history. For example, the US National Archives created a collection titled “Remembering WWI” and within the collection there are photo boards that tell the story of various elements of WWI in relation to the United States (About, historypin.org). Within the collections, users can click on photos and see the exact location of each on Google Maps provided on the side of the webpage, as well as see present images using the Street View images. 

My project differs from historypin because it provides more than just georeferenced photos. Historypin also does not have any collections that feature the Blitz in London during WWII. Through my project users will be able to use historic maps to understand the complementing historic Blitz photos. These sources combined give users a broader understanding of the Blitz and its impact in the past and present. Historypin will provide an excellent example of how the photos from my project can tell the story of a community, and provides a sample of how photos can be georeferenced onto a Google Map, and in coordination with Street View images. 

##### History of Project
The project was conceptualized in October 2017. Preliminary research and planning began in October 2017. This research and planning included finding source maps for the overall project, as well as narrowing down archives that can provide historic photos. In November 2017, the project team was finalized and each individual committed to dedicating time to this project. There has not been any previous financial support or related work done on this specific project. After the project is complete and the website is finished, maintenance on the site will continue indefinitely. This work can be funded by the original grant and possibly future grants. It is also possible that the site can be maintained with funds provided by advertising, for related projects or institutions, on the website. The funds raised by advertising would strictly be used to maintain the site and not for any type of financial gain. 

##### Work Plan (May 2018- July 2019)
This project includes five main collaborators and possible student interns. The project will start will obtaining the rights for the various maps. This will hopefully be accomplished by the end of May 2018. Simultaneously, the team will be working to obtain the rights to the historic photos found in various archives. By the beginning of June 2018, with the maps, the team will begin georeferencing the Bomb Sight map with the satellite Google Map. This will hopefully take 1-2 months to complete. We will then georeference this combined map with the LCC bomb damage maps. This will begin in August 2018 and be complete by November 2018. This step will take longer because there are nine separate LCC maps that cover the city of London. When the map is complete, the process of georeferencing the photos will begin. This will take up the majority of the timeline because of the quantity of photos. This phase of the project is expected to be complete by the end of March 2019. The next step involves creating a free and interactive website that is easy to use. This will be completed by a web developer hired outside the team, but who will work closely with us. The website will be complete by late April- early May 2019. The final step will include an evaluation of the project and to see if its goals stated in the NEH grant were achieved. This evaluation will be provided by three academic scholars, one amateur historian, and five regular public users. This evaluation will be used to see if there needs to be any clarification within the project including any alterations to help make the website and map more user-friendly. The evaluation will be complete by June 2019, and then a month will be dedicated to fix any problems. Finally, in July 2019 the website will be officially launched and open to the public.

##### Final product and dissemination

The project’s website will be disseminated through various outlets. An introductory letter will be created for the project, detailing its features and goals, which will be distributed to all major universities will strong programs dedicated to the study of WWII’s impact on Europe. The letters would be going to these specific universities because these academic scholars would most likely interest and a use for this project. The project will also be briefly presented at various conferences that pertain to the study of WWII, and Britain specifically. These presentations will be done within a year of the project being released to the public. This will hopefully increase the knowledge of the product and the traffic on the website, as well as its use. The project will also be advertised at the various museums and institutions that provide sources for the project, like the Imperial War Museum and the National Archives. It could be possible that these institutions display the final product within an exhibit relating to either the Blitz or understanding changes in the meaning of space and place in Europe. The website will be easy to use so individuals from all backgrounds can utilize this product. The website will be tested to insure that it works in all types of browsers so everyone can equally experience it. Our final product will be published on a website and our white paper will detail the actual process of creating and organizing this project. The white paper will also explain each of the phases, how well they worked, some hurdles that may occur, as well as things that were discarded due to lack of relevance.
