The humanities topic that guided this data collection is the topic of bestseller books in relation to the major 
publishing company of HarperCollins Publishers. I wanted to see what types of books and authors made it 
onto their 2016 bestseller list. 
I recorded 25 books on their 2016 list, this is just a section of the bestseller list. 

With this information we look to generate other data sets from different years to see if their are trends of 
popularity in certain genres or authors within HarperCollins Publishers. We can ask if price of a genre increases if its 
popularity increases. We can look to see if there is a change in the ratio of male to female authors present on the bestseller 
over time. Along with this, we can see if a specific genre is dominated by males or females at differnt periods in the
publisher's history. This list can also indetify the percentage of each genre present on the bestseller list. We can also 
look to see if when a book is released during the year affects its popularity, because many books on list have the same 
release dates.
