The humanities topic that guided this data collection is the topic of bestseller books in relation to the major 
publishing company of HarperCollins Publishers. I wanted to see what types of books and authors made it 
onto their 2016 bestseller list. 
I recorded 25 books on their 2016 list, this is just a section of the bestseller list. 

With this information, we can look to generate other data sets from different years to see if there are trends 
of popularity in certain genres or authors within HarperCollins Publishers. We can ask if price of a genre increases 
if its popularity increases. We can look to see if there is a change in the ratio of male to female authors present 
on the bestseller over time. Along with this, we can see if a specific genre is dominated by males or females at 
different periods in the publisher's history. This list can also identity the percentage of each genre present on 
the bestseller list. We can also look to see if when a book is released during the year affects its popularity, 
because many books on list have the same release dates. The data about the authors can answer the question if age correlates 
to the number of books published. It can also answer if the country of origin determines if a author is published more. We
can also look if being identified as a male or female determines the number of books published through a lifetime.

The source of my first table is the HarperCollins Publishers website, specifically their list of 2016 bestsellers. 
The information within second data set about the authors found on this bestseller list was found on various Wikipedia 
sites about each author.
